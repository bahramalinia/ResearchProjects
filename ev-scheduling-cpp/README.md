# EV-Scheduling

This repository is intended to contain impelmentation for the following EV scheduling algorithms:

# WFAIR: a simple deterministic algorithm which provides competitve ratio of 2-1/U where U is scarcity level.

Constrained EV Charging,” in Proc. of IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Quality of Service (IWQoS), 2018.
acceptance ratio: 20.8%

# FOCS : a simple franctional online scheduling algorithm which provides a competitive ratio of 2
